# Baba's Awesomeness
The list of baba people around the world


Define Baba?

here is an answer from chatgpt:

"In India, the term "baba" is commonly used to refer to spiritual leaders or gurus, who are revered by their followers as spiritual guides or enlightened beings. The term "baba" is often associated with figures who have gained a significant following and have established ashrams or spiritual centers where they impart teachings and offer guidance to their disciples.

It is important to exercise caution when following or placing trust in any spiritual leader, including babas. While there are many genuine and respected spiritual teachers in India, there have also been cases of individuals who misuse their position and exploit their followers for personal gain."


Even chatgpt(represents world's opinion from internet) is giving caution on trusting or following baba, so should we just think ourself?
